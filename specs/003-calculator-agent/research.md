# Research: LangGraph Tool Integration

## Decision

Implement the calculator tool as a custom LangChain tool and integrate it into the LangGraph agent using `langgraph.prebuilt.ToolNode`. This approach allows the agent to dynamically call the calculator tool when a mathematical operation is required, leveraging LangGraph's built-in tool orchestration capabilities.

## Rationale

LangGraph provides robust support for tool integration through `ToolNode`, which simplifies the process of defining, binding, and executing tools within an agent's workflow. By creating a custom tool for calculations, we maintain modularity and allow the LLM to decide when and how to use the calculator, aligning with the agent's functional requirements. The `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` can also be considered for a more high-level approach to tool usage.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Direct LLM calculation**: Relying solely on the LLM to perform calculations. This is less reliable for precise mathematical operations and can be prone to errors, especially for complex expressions.
-   **Manual tool invocation**: Implementing logic within the agent to manually parse queries and call a calculator function. This would increase the complexity of the agent's core logic and bypass LangGraph's automated tool orchestration.
