# Feature Specification: Calculator Agent

**Feature Branch**: `003-calculator-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie um agente que executa uma ferramenta de calculadora, crie ele na pasta agente_tool. Faca ele fazer um calculo de 300/4, adicione a instrucao para ele usar a ferramenta calculadora para calculos."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Agent Performs Calculation with Tool (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want an AI agent that can perform mathematical calculations using a dedicated calculator tool, so that I can get accurate results for my queries.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature, demonstrating the agent's ability to integrate and utilize external tools for specific tasks, which is fundamental for more advanced agent capabilities.

**Independent Test**: The agent can be fully tested by providing a mathematical expression and verifying that it correctly invokes the calculator tool and returns the accurate result.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the agent is initialized with access to a calculator tool, **When** the user asks "quanto Ã© 300 dividido por 4?", **Then** the agent uses the calculator tool to compute the result and responds with "75".

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if the agent is asked a non-mathematical question?
-   How does the system handle invalid mathematical expressions (e.g., division by zero, syntax errors)? (This is a future consideration, not for MVP)

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST initialize an AI agent capable of integrating and using external tools.
-   **FR-002**: The agent MUST have access to a calculator tool that can evaluate mathematical expressions.
-   **FR-003**: The agent MUST be able to identify when a user's query requires a calculation.
-   **FR-004**: The agent MUST invoke the calculator tool with the appropriate mathematical expression when a calculation is needed.
-   **FR-005**: The agent MUST return the result provided by the calculator tool to the user.
-   **FR-006**: The agent's code MUST be located in the `agente_tool` directory.

### Key Entities

-   **Agent**: The AI entity that processes user queries and orchestrates tool usage.
-   **Calculator Tool**: An external function or module capable of evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The agent successfully calculates "300/4" and responds with "75".
-   **SC-002**: The agent responds to the calculation query within 5 seconds.
-   **SC-003**: The agent correctly identifies and uses the calculator tool for mathematical queries 100% of the time.
