# Feature Specification: Sequential Persona Generation Agent

**Feature Branch**: `004-sequential-persona-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie na pasta multi_agentes_sequencial um sistema multi-agentes para geracao e formatacao de uma persona. O primeiro agente deve gerar uma persona aleatoria, com nome, regiao, formacao, medos, gostos, hobbies. O segundo agente transformar o retorno do primeiro em um formato json."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Generate and Format Persona (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want a multi-agent system to generate a random persona and then format it into a JSON structure, so that I can easily use the persona data in other applications.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature, demonstrating the sequential interaction of multiple agents to achieve a complete task, which is a fundamental pattern in multi-agent systems.

**Independent Test**: The system can be fully tested by triggering the persona generation process and verifying that the final output is a valid JSON object containing a randomly generated persona with the specified attributes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the multi-agent system is initialized, **When** the persona generation process is triggered, **Then** the first agent generates a random persona with attributes: name, region, education, fears, likes, and hobbies.
2.  **Given** the first agent has generated a persona, **When** the second agent receives the persona data, **Then** the second agent transforms the persona data into a valid JSON format.
3.  **Given** the persona is generated and formatted, **When** the process completes, **Then** the system outputs the persona in JSON format.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if the first agent fails to generate a complete persona?
-   How does the system handle unexpected output from the first agent that cannot be formatted into JSON by the second agent? (This is a future consideration, not for MVP)

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST consist of at least two agents operating sequentially.
-   **FR-002**: The first agent MUST generate a random persona with the following attributes: name, region, education, fears, likes, and hobbies.
-   **FR-003**: The second agent MUST receive the output from the first agent.
-   **FR-004**: The second agent MUST transform the received persona data into a valid JSON format.
-   **FR-005**: The system MUST output the final persona in JSON format.
-   **FR-006**: The agent's code MUST be located in the `multi_agentes_sequencial` directory.

### Key Entities

-   **Persona**: A fictional character profile with attributes like name, region, education, fears, likes, and hobbies.
-   **Agent (Generator)**: The AI entity responsible for creating the random persona.
-   **Agent (Formatter)**: The AI entity responsible for converting the persona into JSON format.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The system successfully generates a persona with all specified attributes.
-   **SC-002**: The final output is a valid JSON object.
-   **SC-003**: The entire persona generation and formatting process completes within 10 seconds.
-   **SC-004**: The generated persona attributes are diverse and appear random.
