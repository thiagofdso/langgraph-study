# Feature Specification: Web Search Agent Summary

**Feature Branch**: `010-web-search-agent`  
**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie na pasta agente_web um agente que realiza uma pesquisa na web baseada em uma pergunta do usuário, coleta resultados e gera um resumo simples. Para teste use a pergunta simples Como pesquisar arquivos no linux?."

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ask Question and Receive Summary (Priority: P1)

A knowledge-seeking user submits a natural-language question to the agent and receives a concise, easy-to-read summary compiled from recent web sources.

**Why this priority**: Delivering an accurate summary from a user question is the core value of the feature and enables the primary workflow.

**Independent Test**: Submit a unique question, confirm the agent returns a summary referencing multiple sources, and review that the summary conveys at least three distinct insights related to the question.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent is ready to accept input, **When** the user provides a question containing at least five characters and submits it, **Then** the agent acknowledges the request and indicates that a web search is in progress.
2. **Given** web search results are retrieved, **When** the agent displays the summary, **Then** the summary cites at least two distinct sources and highlights the most relevant findings in accessible language.

### User Story 2 - Review Source Details (Priority: P2)

A user who wants to validate the summary can inspect the underlying web search results collected by the agent.

**Why this priority**: Transparency into the supporting information increases trust and helps users confirm accuracy.

**Independent Test**: After the summary is produced, inspect the list of collected results and verify that each entry contains a title, short description, and source reference.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent has completed a search, **When** the user requests supporting details, **Then** the agent presents at least three result entries with titles, short descriptions, and source identifiers.
2. **Given** a user is reviewing results, **When** a result cannot be retrieved or parsed, **Then** the agent flags the entry as unavailable and keeps the rest of the summary accessible.

---

### User Story 3 - Run Default Smoke Test (Priority: P3)

A tester runs the predefined question "Como pesquisar arquivos no linux?" to confirm the agent is working end-to-end before wider use.

**Why this priority**: A repeatable smoke test enables quick verification without crafting new questions each time.

**Independent Test**: Trigger the predefined question, confirm a summary is produced, and ensure the response identifies actionable guidance relevant to the test prompt.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent is available, **When** the tester initiates the default question, **Then** the agent completes the workflow and delivers a summary without requiring manual data entry.
2. **Given** the smoke test summary is displayed, **When** the tester reviews it, **Then** the content provides at least two concrete tips or steps for finding files in Linux.

### Edge Cases

- Empty or extremely short questions are rejected with a clear prompt to provide more detail.
- External web search failures are communicated with an error message and guidance to retry later.
- Limited search results (fewer than two sources) trigger a notice explaining the summary may be incomplete while still returning available insights.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The agent MUST accept a natural-language question entered by the user and confirm receipt before launching any search activity.
- **FR-002**: The agent MUST validate that the question meets minimum clarity (at least five characters after trimming) and prompt the user to adjust if it does not.
- **FR-003**: The agent MUST perform a web search using the provided question and collect at least three relevant results when available.
- **FR-004**: The agent MUST capture for each result a title, short description, and source identifier that can be presented to the user.
- **FR-005**: The agent MUST generate a concise summary that synthesizes the collected results, highlights primary insights, and references the contributing sources.
- **FR-006**: The agent MUST provide the user with access to the list of collected results alongside the summary for transparency.
- **FR-007**: The agent MUST offer a reusable test flow that runs the question "Como pesquisar arquivos no linux?" and records the resulting summary for verification purposes.

### Key Entities

- **Search Query**: Represents the user’s natural-language question, including the text submitted, timestamp, and whether it originated from the default test flow.
- **Search Result Item**: Represents an individual web finding with title, descriptive snippet, source identifier, and ranking position provided to the user.
- **Summary Response**: Represents the synthesized explanation returned to the user, comprising key insights, referenced sources, and any warnings about limited data.

### Assumptions

- The agent relies on web sources that can be accessed without additional authentication during normal operation.
- Summaries are limited to approximately 150 words to remain easy to scan while covering core findings.
- Users understand basic web concepts and can interpret source references such as site names or article titles.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: For the predefined smoke test question, the agent delivers a complete summary within 10 seconds in at least 95% of trial runs during user acceptance testing.
- **SC-002**: Across pilot usage, at least 80% of user-submitted questions produce summaries referencing two or more distinct sources.
- **SC-003**: In post-session surveys, 90% of users rate the clarity of the generated summaries at 4 out of 5 or higher.
- **SC-004**: QA testers can execute the smoke test workflow end-to-end, including reviewing sources, in under 2 minutes without manual data gathering.
