# Feature Specification: FAQ Routing Agent

**Feature Branch**: `[012-faq-routing-agent]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Quero um projeto para estudo. Crie na pasta agente_perguntas um agente que responde perguntas frequentes a partir de um arquivo/fonte fixa, identificando se uma dúvida precisa de encaminhamento para humano. Elabore um FAQ ficticio para ser usado. O programa deve conter 2 perguntas que o agente consegue responder com esse FAQ e uma terceira pergunta que requer encaminhamento para um humano."

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Answer known FAQ question (Priority: P1)

As a learner running the study agent, I can ask a question that matches the fictitious FAQ and receive a clear answer drawn directly from the FAQ content so I can see how deterministic responses work.

**Why this priority**: Delivering a correct answer from fixed knowledge is the core value proposition; without it the project fails its purpose.

**Independent Test**: Execute the agent, submit a question verbatim from the FAQ (e.g., "Como altero minha senha?"), and verify the answer mirrors the FAQ entry without referencing external sources.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the FAQ file is loaded, **When** the user asks a question that exactly matches an FAQ entry, **Then** the agent returns the stored answer and labels it as resolved.
2. **Given** the FAQ file is loaded, **When** the user asks a question that paraphrases a stored FAQ entry, **Then** the agent matches it and returns the closest answer with a confidence explanation.

### User Story 2 - Flag unresolved question (Priority: P2)

As a learner, I can ask a question outside the FAQ and have the agent identify that it cannot respond and should escalate to a human, demonstrating routing logic.

**Why this priority**: Escalation showcases decision-making and prevents misleading answers, which is a key learning outcome.

**Independent Test**: Run the agent, submit a question absent from the FAQ (e.g., "Vocês oferecem suporte 24h?"), and confirm the agent responds with a polite handoff message indicating human follow-up is required.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the question is not covered by the FAQ, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the agent explicitly states it cannot answer and flags the interaction for human review.
2. **Given** the agent flags a question, **When** the interaction summary is displayed, **Then** it lists the question under a "Necessita atendimento humano" section.

### User Story 3 - Demonstrate scripted FAQ session (Priority: P3)

As a learner validating the project, I can run the agent once and observe an automatic flow that shows two answerable questions and one escalated question in sequence, confirming expected outputs without manual input.

**Why this priority**: A reproducible demo ensures evaluators observe the intended behaviour quickly and confirms documentation accuracy.

**Independent Test**: Execute `python agente_perguntas/main.py` and verify that it automatically runs the three sample questions (dois resolvidos, um escalado) and that the printed transcript matches the README examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the scripted run executes automatically, **When** it processes the first two sample questions, **Then** the agent outputs the FAQ answers verbatim.
2. **Given** o fluxo automático alcança a terceira pergunta de exemplo, **When** determina que não há correspondência no FAQ, **Then** imprime um aviso de escalonamento e marca a questão para acompanhamento humano.

### Edge Cases

- FAQ file is missing or unreadable—agent must surface a clear error instructing the learner to restore the source file.
- FAQ entries contain duplicate questions—agent should warn about duplicates rather than arbitrarily selecting one.
- User submits an empty or whitespace-only question—agent prompts for a valid question instead of crashing.
- Multiple FAQ entries partially match with similar scores—agent should describe the tie or ask the user to pick.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The agent MUST load a fictitious FAQ data source from within `agente_perguntas` at startup and validate that required fields (question, answer, tags) are present.
- **FR-002**: The agent MUST answer user questions by selecting the closest FAQ match and returning the stored answer when the confidence score exceeds a documented threshold.
- **FR-003**: The agent MUST detect questions that fall below the confidence threshold and produce an explicit escalation response for human follow-up.
- **FR-004**: The agent MUST incluir três perguntas de exemplo (duas resolvidas, uma escalada) e executá-las automaticamente em uma única execução para fins demonstrativos.
- **FR-005**: The agent MUST log or display a concise interaction summary showing which questions were resolved automatically versus routed to a human.

### Key Entities

- **FAQ Entry**: Represents a single question-answer pair with optional tags; used as the knowledge base for automatic replies.
- **Interaction Record**: Captures a user question, the selected FAQ match (if any), confidence score, and final resolution status ("resolved" or "human needed").
- **Escalation Summary**: Aggregated list of Interaction Records flagged for human attention, including the original question and timestamp/order.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- The study project runs in a local environment without external data sources; all FAQ content is bundled with the codebase.
- Matching can rely on simple similarity techniques (e.g., keyword overlap) since this is an introductory project.
- Manual tests via CLI inputs are sufficient; no automated testing framework is required.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: On a fresh run, the FAQ source loads successfully in under 2 seconds and confirms the number of entries loaded.
- **SC-002**: For the two provided sample questions covered by the FAQ, the agent returns the correct answers with a confidence score of at least 0.7 (or the documented threshold) every time.
- **SC-003**: For the sample question outside the FAQ, the agent produces an escalation response within 3 seconds, including guidance that a human will respond.
- **SC-004**: The scripted demo outputs all three sample interactions consecutively, clearly labelling each as "Respondido automaticamente" or "Encaminhar para humano", matching the README transcript.
