# Research Findings: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Report Generation

## Decision: Langgraph for Agent Orchestration
- **Rationale**: Langgraph is explicitly requested by the user and is the standard framework for agent development in this project (Constitution V). The provided example code demonstrates its suitability for orchestrating agents.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as Langgraph is mandated.

## Decision: Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM
- **Rationale**: Gemini 2.5 Flash is explicitly requested by the user and is the standard LLM for this project (Constitution IV).
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as Gemini 2.5 Flash is mandated.

## Decision: Langchain for LLM Integration
- **Rationale**: The provided example code uses `llm.invoke`, which is a common pattern with Langchain. The project's `GEMINI.md` also indicates `langchain` and `langchain-google-genai` are used for tools and LLM integration in similar projects.
- **Alternatives considered**: Direct API calls to Google Generative AI, but Langchain provides a convenient abstraction.

## Decision: Environment Variable Management via .env
- **Rationale**: Constitution XII mandates copying the `.env` file from `agente_simples` for consistent environment variable management.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as this is a constitutional requirement.

## Research: Dynamic Section Generation by Orchestrator Agent
- **Question**: How can the orchestrator agent dynamically generate report sections (subtasks) using an LLM based on the input theme?
- **Findings**: The orchestrator agent can leverage the LLM to analyze the input `topic` and generate a list of relevant sections for a report. This can be achieved by prompting the LLM with the topic and asking it to outline a report structure, specifying the desired format for the sections (e.g., a list of dictionaries with 'name' and 'description'). The LLM's output can then be parsed to populate the `sections` attribute of the `State`.
- **Decision**: The orchestrator agent will use `llm.invoke` with a carefully crafted prompt to dynamically generate a list of sections. The prompt will instruct the LLM to provide sections in a structured format that can be easily parsed (e.g., JSON or a specific string format).
- **Alternatives considered**: Hardcoding sections (rejected as per user's request for dynamic sections), using a rule-based system (less flexible than LLM).
