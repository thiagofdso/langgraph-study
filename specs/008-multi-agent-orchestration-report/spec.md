# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Report Generation

**Feature Branch**: `008-multi-agent-orchestration-report`  
**Created**: Tuesday, October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie na pasta multi_agentes_orquestracao um sistema multi agentes em que ocorra o seguinte: Orquestrador: Recebe o tema, faz o plano do relatório, determina as seções (subtarefas). Workers: Cada worker recebe uma seção e gera seu texto (trabalham em paralelo). Orquestrador/Sintetizador: Consolida todas as seções escritas pelos workers em um relatório final. Lembre, o proximo requisito é o 008"

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate Comprehensive Report (Priority: P1)

A user provides a theme, and the system generates a comprehensive report. An orchestrator agent plans the report and determines sections, worker agents generate text for their assigned sections in parallel, and the orchestrator/synthesizer consolidates these sections into a final report.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature, delivering immediate value by showcasing the multi-agent orchestration and report generation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a theme and verifying that a coherent, multi-section report is generated and presented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user provides a theme, **When** the orchestrator receives it, **Then** a plan for the report is generated, and distinct sections (subtasks) are determined.
2.  **Given** sections are determined, **When** worker agents receive their respective sections, **Then** each worker generates relevant and coherent text for its section in parallel.
3.  **Given** all sections are written by worker agents, **When** the orchestrator/synthesizer consolidates them, **Then** a final, coherent, and comprehensive report is produced.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if the orchestrator cannot generate a viable plan or determine sections for the given theme?
-   How does the system handle a worker agent failing to generate text for its assigned section?
-   What if the input theme is too broad or too narrow to generate a comprehensive report with distinct sections?
-   How does the orchestrator handle conflicting, redundant, or low-quality information from worker agents during the consolidation phase?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a theme (e.g., "The Future of AI") as input for report generation.
-   **FR-002**: An orchestrator agent MUST be capable of generating a structured report plan and determining distinct sections (subtasks) based on the input theme.
-   **FR-003**: The system MUST initiate multiple worker agents in parallel, each assigned to generate text content for a specific section of the report.
-   **FR-004**: Each worker agent MUST generate relevant, coherent, and high-quality text for its assigned section.
-   **FR-005**: The orchestrator/synthesizer MUST consolidate the text content from all worker agents into a single, final, and well-structured report.
-   **FR-006**: The final report MUST be presented to the user.

### Key Entities

-   **Theme**: The input string provided by the user that defines the subject of the report.
-   **Report Plan**: A structured outline generated by the orchestrator, detailing the sections and their order for the final report.
-   **Section (Subtask)**: A distinct part of the report, representing a specific topic or area, assigned to a worker agent for content generation.
-   **Orchestrator Agent**: The primary agent responsible for overall report planning, task distribution to worker agents, and final report synthesis.
-   **Worker Agent**: An agent responsible for generating detailed text content for a specific `Section` as directed by the `Orchestrator Agent`.
-   **Final Report**: The complete, consolidated document containing all generated sections, presented as the system's output.

### Assumptions

-   The system has access to underlying LLMs or knowledge bases capable of generating relevant content for various themes and sections.
-   Worker agents can operate independently and in parallel without significant inter-agent communication during content generation.
-   The orchestrator has sufficient intelligence to effectively plan, distribute tasks, and synthesize diverse content into a cohesive report.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 100% of user-provided themes result in a generated report with at least three distinct sections.
-   **SC-002**: The average time from theme input to final report generation is under 60 seconds.
-   **SC-003**: 90% of generated reports are rated by users as coherent, comprehensive, and highly relevant to the input theme.
-   **SC-004**: The system successfully utilizes parallel processing for worker agents, demonstrating a measurable efficiency gain (e.g., 2x faster) compared to a hypothetical sequential processing approach for generating section content.
