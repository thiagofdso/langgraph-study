# Data Model: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Report Generation

## Entity: State

Represents the shared state across the Langgraph nodes, holding the input theme, dynamically generated sections, completed section contents, and the final report.

### Attributes

-   **topic** (string): The input theme provided by the user. This is the initial state.
-   **sections** (List[Section], optional): A list of `Section` objects dynamically generated by the Orchestrator Agent. Each `Section` object contains at least 'name' and 'description' attributes.
-   **completed_sections** (List[str], optional): A list of strings, where each string is the generated content for a specific section by a Worker Agent.
-   **final_report** (string, optional): The consolidated report generated by the Synthesizer.

## Entity: Section

Represents a single section or subtask of the report.

### Attributes

-   **name** (string): The title or name of the section (e.g., "Introduction", "Key Findings").
-   **description** (string): A brief description or prompt for the content to be generated for this section.

### Relationships

-   `topic` is consumed by the `Orchestrator Agent` to generate `sections`.
-   `sections` are distributed to `Worker Agents`.
-   `Worker Agents` produce content that populates `completed_sections`.
-   `completed_sections` are consumed by the `Synthesizer` to produce the `final_report`.
