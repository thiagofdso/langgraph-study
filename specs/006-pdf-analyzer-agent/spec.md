# Feature Specification: PDF Analyzer Agent for OpenShift Jaeger Operator Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `006-pdf-analyzer-agent`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie na pasta agente_pdf um agente que analisa o pdf openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf e responde como implantar o operator do jaeger usando web console do openshift."

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Analyze PDF and Get Jaeger Operator Deployment Steps (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to provide a PDF document (specifically `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`) to the agent, and receive clear instructions on how to deploy the Jaeger operator using the OpenShift web console.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested by the user.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing the specified PDF and verifying the agent's response contains accurate deployment steps for the Jaeger operator via the OpenShift web console.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the agent is running and accessible, **When** I provide the `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf` file, **Then** the agent processes the PDF content.
2.  **Given** the PDF is processed, **When** I ask "how to deploy the Jaeger operator using the OpenShift web console?", **Then** the agent responds with step-by-step instructions relevant to the PDF content.
3.  **Given** the agent provides instructions, **When** the instructions are followed, **Then** the Jaeger operator can be successfully deployed via the OpenShift web console.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the provided PDF is corrupted or unreadable?
- How does the system handle PDFs that do not contain information about Jaeger operator deployment on OpenShift?
- What if the user asks a question not directly related to the PDF content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The agent MUST be able to receive a PDF file as input.
- **FR-002**: The agent MUST be able to extract and understand textual content from the provided PDF.
- **FR-003**: The agent MUST be able to answer questions related to the content of the PDF.
- **FR-004**: The agent MUST be able to provide instructions on deploying the Jaeger operator using the OpenShift web console, based on the PDF content.
- **FR-005**: The agent MUST be able to handle the specific PDF `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`.

### Key Entities

- **PDF Document**: The input file containing information.
- **Agent**: The system component responsible for processing the PDF and generating responses.
- **User Query**: The question posed by the user to the agent.
- **Deployment Instructions**: The step-by-step guide generated by the agent.

### Assumptions

- The provided PDF (`openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`) is a valid, readable PDF document.
- The content within the PDF is in English and contains the necessary information regarding Jaeger operator deployment via the OpenShift web console.
- The agent has access to the PDF file and the necessary libraries/tools to parse its content.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The agent successfully processes the specified PDF and provides relevant deployment instructions in 95% of attempts.
- **SC-002**: Users can obtain accurate Jaeger operator deployment steps from the PDF within 30 seconds of submitting the PDF and query.
- **SC-003**: The agent's responses are clear, concise, and directly answer the user's questions regarding the PDF content.
