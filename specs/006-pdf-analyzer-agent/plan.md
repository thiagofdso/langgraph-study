# Implementation Plan: PDF Analyzer Agent for OpenShift Jaeger Operator Deployment

**Branch**: `006-pdf-analyzer-agent` | **Date**: October 28, 2025 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/006-pdf-analyzer-agent/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-pdf-analyzer-agent/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to create a PDF analyzer agent that utilizes `langgraph` and `gemini-2.5-flash`. This agent will convert a given PDF document (specifically `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`) into a base64 encoded string, send it to the LLM for analysis, and then respond in Markdown format with instructions on deploying the Jaeger operator via the OpenShift web console.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: `langgraph`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `langchain-google-genai`, `base64` (built-in Python library for PDF to base64 conversion).
**Storage**: In-memory state management (for this simple agent).
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single project (agent)
**Performance Goals**: Users can obtain accurate Jaeger operator deployment steps from the PDF within 30 seconds of submitting the PDF and query.
**Constraints**: No validation is required to check if the input PDF file exists. The agent's response MUST be in Markdown format.
**Scale/Scope**: Analysis of a single PDF document to extract specific deployment instructions.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Main File for Testing**: The agent's `main.py` will serve as an executable entry point for demonstration and testing.
- [x] **II. Continuous Learning & Best Practices**: Research will be conducted for PDF to base64 conversion libraries and best practices for integrating multimodal input with `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- [x] **III. Focused Testing Strategy**: Tests will focus on PDF processing, base64 encoding, and the structure of the LLM interaction, not on the LLM's non-deterministic output.
- [x] **IV. Standard LLM Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` is explicitly specified and will be used.
- [x] **V. Standard Agent Framework**: `langgraph` is explicitly specified and will be used.
- [x] **VI. Code Simplicity**: Code will be kept simple and readable.
- [x] **VII. Documentation & Comments**: Code will be documented, especially for PDF processing and LLM interaction logic.
- [x] **VIII. Python Development Standards**: Python 3.11, `venv`, and `requirements.txt` will be used. Dependencies will be added as needed.
- [x] **IX. Change Approval Process**: Significant changes will follow the approval process.
- [x] **X. Project Module Structure**: The agent will reside in `agente_pdf/` to avoid nested module folders.
- [x] **XI. Relative Path Usage**: Relative paths will be preferred where applicable.
- [x] **XII. Environment Configuration**: `.env` file will be used for configuration.
- [x] **XIII. Preferred Research Tools**: `perplexity` will be used for researching PDF to base64 conversion.
- [x] **XIV. Specification-Driven Development**: This feature is being developed using the `.specify` framework.

**Structure Decision**: The agent will be implemented within a new `agente_pdf/` directory, following the existing project structure for other agents. A `utils.py` file will be created within this directory to encapsulate PDF processing and base64 conversion logic. A corresponding test file `test_agente_pdf.py` will be created in the `tests/` directory.
