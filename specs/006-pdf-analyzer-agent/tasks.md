# Tasks: PDF Analyzer Agent for OpenShift Jaeger Operator Deployment

**Feature Name**: PDF Analyzer Agent for OpenShift Jaeger Operator Deployment
**Branch**: `006-pdf-analyzer-agent` | **Date**: October 28, 2025 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/006-pdf-analyzer-agent/spec.md

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create `agente_pdf` directory at `agente_pdf/`
- [x] T002 Create `__init__.py` at `agente_pdf/__init__.py`
- [x] T003 Create `main.py` at `agente_pdf/main.py`
- [x] T004 Create `README.md` at `agente_pdf/README.md`
- [x] T005 Create `utils.py` at `agente_pdf/utils.py`
- [x] T006 Remove `test_agente_pdf.py` at `tests/test_agente_pdf.py` (as per user request, no unit/integration tests needed)
- [x] T007 Update `requirements.txt` with `google-generativeai`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain_community`, `pypdf`

## Phase 2: Foundational

- [x] T008 Remove `pdf_to_base64` function from `agente_pdf/utils.py`.
- [x] T009 Remove argument parsing for `--pdf_path` and `--query` in `agente_pdf/main.py` and hardcode values.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Analyze PDF and Get Jaeger Operator Deployment Steps [US1]

- [x] T010 [US1] Implement `load_and_parse_pdf` node in `agente_pdf/main.py` to load PDF and extract text content using `PyPDFLoader`.
- [x] T011 [US1] Modify `invoke_llm` node in `agente_pdf/main.py` to use extracted text content as context for the LLM.
- [x] T012 [US1] Implement `parse_llm_response` node in `agente_pdf/main.py` to process LLM response.
- [x] T013 [US1] Build and compile the `StateGraph` with defined nodes and edges in `agente_pdf/main.py`.
- [x] T014 [US1] Implement the main execution logic to parse arguments, initialize state, invoke the graph, and print the output in `agente_pdf/main.py`.

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T015 Update `agente_pdf/README.md` with detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 (Setup) must be completed before Phase 2 (Foundational).
- Phase 2 (Foundational) must be completed before Phase 3 (User Story 1).
- Tasks within each phase are generally sequential, but some can be parallelized as indicated.

## Parallel Execution Examples

### User Story 1

- T010 (Implement `load_and_parse_pdf` node) and T011 (Modify `invoke_llm` node) can be developed in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, focusing on delivering User Story 1 as the core functionality. Subsequent enhancements or additional user stories will be considered in future iterations. Incremental delivery will be achieved by completing tasks phase by phase, ensuring that each user story is verifiable by executing `main.py` upon completion.
