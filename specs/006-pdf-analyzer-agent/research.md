## PDF to Base64 Conversion

### Decision

Use Python's built-in `base64` library for converting PDF files to Base64 encoded strings.

### Rationale

The `base64` library is a standard component of Python, which means it does not introduce any new external dependencies to the project. This aligns with the principle of keeping the codebase simple and minimizing external requirements. The library provides direct functionality for encoding binary data, such as PDF files, into a Base64 string format, which is suitable for sending as part of a multimodal message to the LLM.

### Alternatives Considered

No external libraries were considered necessary after discovering the capability of the built-in `base64` library. This approach is preferred for its simplicity and lack of additional overhead.
