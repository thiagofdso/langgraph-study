# Feature Specification: PDF to Markdown Converter

**Feature Branch**: `009-pdf-to-md-converter`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Crie um programa na pasta pdf_to_md que converte o arquivo pdf openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf para markdown. Pode deixar fixo esse arquivo."

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Convert a specific PDF to Markdown (Priority: P1)

A user wants to convert a pre-defined PDF file (`openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`) located in the project root to a Markdown file. The output Markdown file should be saved in a specified directory (`pdf_to_md`).

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested by the user and provides immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the conversion program with the specified PDF and verifying the output Markdown file's existence and content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf` file exists in the project root, **When** the conversion program is executed, **Then** a Markdown file is created in the `pdf_to_md` directory.
2.  **Given** the conversion program is executed, **When** the Markdown file is created, **Then** the content of the Markdown file accurately represents the text and structure of the original PDF.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the source PDF file does not exist? The program should handle this gracefully, e.g., by raising an error or printing a message.
- How does the system handle complex PDF layouts (e.g., tables, images, multi-column text)? The conversion should attempt to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, but some loss of fidelity is expected.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The program MUST be located in a directory named `pdf_to_md`.
- **FR-002**: The program MUST convert the PDF file `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf` (located in the project root) to Markdown.
- **FR-003**: The program MUST save the generated Markdown file in the `pdf_to_md` directory.
- **FR-004**: The program MUST be able to extract text content from the PDF.
- **FR-005**: The program SHOULD attempt to preserve the formatting and structure of the PDF content in the Markdown output.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **PDF Document**: The input file containing text and potentially other elements.
- **Markdown Document**: The output file containing text formatted with Markdown syntax.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The conversion program successfully generates a Markdown file from the specified PDF 100% of the time when the input PDF is valid and present.
- **SC-002**: The generated Markdown file is readable and contains all significant text content from the original PDF.
- **SC-003**: The program completes the conversion of the specified PDF within 30 seconds.
