# Tasks: PDF to Markdown Converter

**Branch**: `009-pdf-to-md-converter` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/009-pdf-to-md-converter/spec.md

## Phase 1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create the `pdf_to_md` directory at the project root.
- [x] T002 Create the `main.py` file inside `pdf_to_md/`.
- [x] T003 Add `docling` to `requirements.txt`.
- [x] T004 Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

*(No specific foundational tasks beyond setup for this simple feature.)*

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Convert a specific PDF to Markdown (Priority: P1)

**Story Goal**: A user can convert a pre-defined PDF file to Markdown, with the output saved in a specified directory.

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- The conversion program can be executed directly via `python pdf_to_md/main.py`.
- A Markdown file is created in the `pdf_to_md` directory.
- The content of the Markdown file accurately represents the text and structure of the original PDF.

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [x] T005 [US1] Implement PDF to Markdown conversion logic in `pdf_to_md/main.py` using `docling.document_converter.DocumentConverter`.
- [x] T006 [US1] Configure `pdf_to_md/main.py` to use the fixed input PDF path: `/root/code/langgraph/openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`.
- [x] T007 [US1] Implement logic in `pdf_to_md/main.py` to save the generated Markdown content to a file in the `pdf_to_md` directory. The output filename should be derived from the input PDF filename (e.g., `openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.md`).
- [x] T008 [US1] Add basic error handling in `pdf_to_md/main.py` for cases where the input PDF file does not exist.

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T009 Add necessary comments and documentation to `pdf_to_md/main.py`.
- [x] T010 Ensure the code in `pdf_to_md/main.py` adheres to Python best practices and style guidelines.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 tasks must be completed before proceeding to Phase 3.
- Tasks within Phase 3 are sequential.

## Parallel Execution Examples

*(No significant parallel execution opportunities identified for this feature due to its sequential nature.)*

## Implementation Strategy

This feature will be implemented incrementally, focusing on delivering the core PDF to Markdown conversion functionality first (User Story 1). The implementation will prioritize clarity and directness, given the constraint of no unit/integration tests and direct execution via `main.py`.
