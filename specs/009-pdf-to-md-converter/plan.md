# Implementation Plan: PDF to Markdown Converter

**Branch**: `009-pdf-to-md-converter` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/009-pdf-to-md-converter/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-pdf-to-md-converter/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Convert a specified PDF file (`openshift_container_platform-4.9-distributed_tracing-en-us.pdf`) to Markdown format using the `docling` library, saving the output in a `pdf_to_md` directory.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: `docling`, `langgraph`
**Storage**: Filesystem
**Testing**: Manual execution via `main.py`
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI tool)
**Performance Goals**: Convert the specified PDF within 30 seconds
**Constraints**: No unit or integration tests, no `.env` file needed.
**Scale/Scope**: Single PDF conversion, fixed input file.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Main File for Testing**: Pass. `main.py` will serve as the entry point for testing.
- **III. Focused Testing Strategy**: Pass. User explicitly stated "Não crie testes unitarios nem de integracao, teste usando direto o main.py." This aligns with focusing on integration and deterministic components.
- **VIII. Python Development Standards**: Pass. Python 3.11 is specified. `requirements.txt` will be used for dependencies.
- **X. Project Module Structure**: Pass. A new `pdf_to_md` directory will be created.
- **XII. Environment Configuration**: Violation. The user explicitly stated "Esse projeto não precisa de .env então nao copie." This is a justified deviation from the constitution.
- **XIV. Specification-Driven Development**: Pass. This process is being followed.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| XII. Environment Configuration | User explicitly stated that this project does not require an `.env` file and instructed not to copy it. | Adhering to the constitution would introduce an unnecessary `.env` file for a project that doesn't use environment variables. |

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
pdf_to_md/
├── main.py
```

**Structure Decision**: The program will reside in a new directory `pdf_to_md` at the project root, containing `main.py` as the entry point.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |

| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
