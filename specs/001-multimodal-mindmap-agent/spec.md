# Feature Specification: Multimodal Mindmap Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-multimodal-mindmap-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie um agente multimodal na pasta agente_imagem que analise o mapa mental do arquivo folder_map.png e retorne com o mapa mental estruturado em markdown de forma hierarquica."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Analyze Mind Map Image (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to provide a mind map image (`folder_map.png`) to the multimodal agent, so that it can analyze the image and return a hierarchical markdown representation of the mind map.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature.

**Independent Test**: The agent can be fully tested by providing a `folder_map.png` image and verifying that the output is a well-structured hierarchical markdown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a `folder_map.png` image is provided to the multimodal agent, **When** the agent analyzes the image, **Then** it returns a markdown string representing the hierarchical structure of the mind map.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST include a multimodal agent.
-   **FR-002**: The multimodal agent MUST be located in the `agente_imagem` folder.
-   **FR-003**: The multimodal agent MUST be able to analyze an image file named `folder_map.png`.
-   **FR-004**: The multimodal agent MUST extract the hierarchical structure from the mind map image.
-   **FR-005**: The multimodal agent MUST return the extracted hierarchical structure as a markdown string.
-   **FR-006**: The agent will *only* process `folder_map.png` and generate markdown. No other image formats or output types are in scope.

### Key Entities

-   **Multimodal Agent**: An agent capable of processing image input.
-   **Mind Map Image**: An image file (`folder_map.png`) containing a mind map.
-   **Hierarchical Markdown**: A markdown string representing the structured content of the mind map, including node text and hierarchical level.

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR-001**: The multimodal agent MUST process a `folder_map.png` image within a maximum of 60 seconds.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The multimodal agent successfully processes `folder_map.png` and returns a markdown output for 100% of valid mind map images.
-   **SC-002**: The generated markdown output accurately reflects the hierarchical structure of the mind map image.
-   **SC-003**: The markdown output is well-formatted and easy to read.

## Assumptions



-   The `folder_map.png` image will be a clear and readable mind map.

-   The agent will have access to the image file.

-   The definition of "hierarchical markdown" implies using markdown headings, lists, or indentation to represent the mind map's structure.



## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: What are the explicit out-of-scope declarations for this feature? → A: The agent will *only* process `folder_map.png` and generate markdown. No other image formats or output types are in scope.
- Q: How should the agent handle unclear/unreadable mind map images or images that are not mind maps? → A: Log the issue and terminate processing without returning any output.
- Q: What specific attributes and relationships should be extracted from the mind map image and represented in the hierarchical markdown? → A: Node text and hierarchical level only.
- Q: What are the performance expectations (e.g., maximum processing time for an image)? → A: Maximum 60 seconds per image.
- Q: Are there any specific technical constraints (e.g., preferred image processing libraries, maximum image size) that the agent must adhere to? → A: No specific image size constraint.

### Edge Cases

-   **Unclear/Unreadable Images**: The agent will log the issue and terminate processing without returning any output.
-   **Non-Mind Map Images**: The agent will log the issue and terminate processing without returning any output.
-   **Complex Mind Maps**: How will the agent handle extremely large or intricate mind maps with many levels and cross-connections?
