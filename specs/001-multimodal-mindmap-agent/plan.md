# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `001-multimodal-mindmap-agent` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/001-multimodal-mindmap-agent/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements a multimodal agent to analyze a mind map image (`folder_map.png`) and generate a hierarchical markdown output. The agent, located in `agente_imagem`, will use Python 3.11, `langgraph`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, and `langchain-google-genai`. It will extract node text and hierarchical levels from the image within 60 seconds. Unclear or non-mind map images will be logged, and processing will terminate.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: langgraph, google-generativeai, python-dotenv, langchain-google-genai
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single
**Performance Goals**: 60 seconds per image
**Constraints**: No specific image size constraint
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, single image processing at a time
## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Main File for Testing**: The agent will have a `main.py` that demonstrates its core functionality. (PASS)
- **II. Continuous Learning & Best Practices**: This will be followed during implementation. (PASS)
- **III. Focused Testing Strategy**: Tests will focus on integration and deterministic components. (PASS)
- **IV. Standard LLM Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` will be used. (PASS)
- **V. Standard Agent Framework**: `langgraph` will be used. (PASS)
- **VI. Code Simplicity**: Will be adhered to. (PASS)
- **VII. Documentation & Comments**: Will be adhered to. (PASS)
- **VIII. Python Development Standards**: Python, `venv`, `requirements.txt` will be used. (PASS)
- **IX. Change Approval Process**: Will be followed. (PASS)
- **X. Project Module Structure**: The agent will be in `agente_imagem`, avoiding nested modules. (PASS)
- **XI. Relative Path Usage**: Will be preferred. (PASS)
- **XII. Environment Configuration**: `.env` file structure will be replicated. (PASS)
- **XIII. Preferred Research Tools**: `mcp` and `perplexity` will be used. (PASS)

**Structure Decision**: The agent will reside in a dedicated `agente_imagem` directory at the project root, following a single project structure. Tests will be in `tests/test_agente_imagem.py`.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
