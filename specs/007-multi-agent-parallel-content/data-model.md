# Data Model: Multi-Agent Parallel Content Generation

## Entity: State

Represents the shared state across the Langgraph nodes, holding the input topic and the generated content from each agent, as well as the final combined output.

### Attributes

-   **topic** (string): The input topic provided by the user. This is the initial state.
-   **joke** (string, optional): The joke generated by the Joke Agent. Populated after `call_llm_1` node execution.
-   **story** (string, optional): The story generated by the Story Agent. Populated after `call_llm_2` node execution.
-   **poem** (string, optional): The poem generated by the Poem Agent. Populated after `call_llm_3` node execution.
-   **combined_output** (string, optional): The aggregated output from all agents. Populated after `aggregator` node execution.

### Relationships

-   `topic` is consumed by `Joke Agent`, `Story Agent`, and `Poem Agent`.
-   `joke`, `story`, and `poem` are produced by their respective agents and consumed by the `Aggregator`.
-   `combined_output` is produced by the `Aggregator`.

### Validation Rules

-   `topic` must be a non-empty string.
