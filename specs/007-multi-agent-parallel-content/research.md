# Research Findings: Multi-Agent Parallel Content Generation

## Decision: Langgraph for Parallel Agent Orchestration
- **Rationale**: Langgraph is explicitly requested by the user and is the standard framework for agent development in this project (Constitution V). The provided example code demonstrates its suitability for parallel execution.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as Langgraph is mandated.

## Decision: Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM
- **Rationale**: Gemini 2.5 Flash is explicitly requested by the user and is the standard LLM for this project (Constitution IV).
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as Gemini 2.5 Flash is mandated.

## Decision: Langchain for LLM Integration
- **Rationale**: The provided example code uses `llm.invoke`, which is a common pattern with Langchain. The project's `GEMINI.md` also indicates `langchain` and `langchain-google-genai` are used for tools and LLM integration in similar projects.
- **Alternatives considered**: Direct API calls to Google Generative AI, but Langchain provides a convenient abstraction.

## Decision: Environment Variable Management via .env
- **Rationale**: Constitution XII mandates copying the `.env` file from `agente_simples` for consistent environment variable management.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as this is a constitutional requirement.
