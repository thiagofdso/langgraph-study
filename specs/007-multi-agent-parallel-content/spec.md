# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Parallel Content Generation

**Feature Branch**: `007-multi-agent-parallel-content`  
**Created**: Tuesday, October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie na pasta muito_agentes_paralelo um sistema multi agentes em paralelo. O sistema recebe um tópico (ex: "gatos") e dispara três agentes em paralelo: Agente 1: Gera uma piada sobre o tópico Agente 2: Gera uma história sobre o tópico Agente 3: Gera um poema sobre o tópico Depois que os três terminam, um agregador combina todos os resultados em uma saída única. Lembre-se o proximo requisito é o 007."

**Note**: This specification is an integral part of the specification-driven development process, generated and managed using the `.specify` framework, ensuring clear requirements and alignment with project goals.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate Combined Creative Content (Priority: P1)

A user provides a topic (e.g., "cats") and the system generates a joke, a story, and a poem about that topic in parallel, then combines them into a single output.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature, delivering immediate value by showcasing the parallel content generation and aggregation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a topic and verifying that a combined output containing a joke, story, and poem is returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user provides a topic, **When** the system processes it, **Then** a single output containing a joke, a story, and a poem related to the topic is returned.
2.  **Given** a user provides a topic, **When** all three agents complete their tasks, **Then** the aggregator successfully combines their outputs.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if one or more agents fail to generate content for a given topic?
-   How does the system handle very broad or very specific topics, or topics that might be sensitive?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a single topic (e.g., "gatos") as input.
-   **FR-002**: The system MUST initiate three parallel content generation agents: one for a joke, one for a story, and one for a poem, all based on the input topic.
-   **FR-003**: Each content generation agent MUST produce output relevant to its designated content type (joke, story, or poem) and the provided topic.
-   **FR-004**: The system MUST include an aggregation mechanism that combines the outputs from all three parallel agents into a single, coherent response.
-   **FR-005**: The final aggregated response MUST be presented to the user.

### Key Entities

-   **Topic**: The input string provided by the user that serves as the subject for content generation.
-   **Joke Agent**: A specialized agent responsible for generating humorous content (a joke) related to the given topic.
-   **Story Agent**: A specialized agent responsible for generating narrative content (a story) related to the given topic.
-   **Poem Agent**: A specialized agent responsible for generating poetic content (a poem) related to the given topic.
-   **Aggregator**: A system component responsible for collecting and combining the individual outputs from the Joke, Story, and Poem Agents into a unified response.
-   **Combined Output**: The final, single piece of content presented to the user, comprising the joke, story, and poem.

### Assumptions

-   The system has access to underlying models or services capable of generating jokes, stories, and poems based on a given topic.
-   The input topic will be in a language understood by the content generation agents.
-   The content generated by individual agents will be in a format that can be easily aggregated.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: 100% of user-provided topics result in a combined output containing a joke, a story, and a poem.
-   **SC-002**: The average end-to-end response time for generating and aggregating content is under 10 seconds.
-   **SC-003**: 90% of users rate the generated content as relevant, creative, and coherent for the given topic.
