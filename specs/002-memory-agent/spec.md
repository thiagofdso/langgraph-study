# Feature Specification: Memory Agent

**Feature Branch**: `002-memory-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Crie um agente com memória na pasta agente_memoria, usando gemini, ele deve enviar uma pergunta inicial: quanto é 1+1, depois da ia responder, deve mandar mais uma pergunta \"Qual foi minha primeira pergunta?\". A ideia é testar a memoria, tente aproveitar codigo do agente_simples."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Agent Recalls Previous Question (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to interact with an AI agent that can remember our conversation history, so that it can answer questions based on previous interactions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature, demonstrating the agent's ability to maintain context and memory, which is essential for more complex conversational agents.

**Independent Test**: The agent can be fully tested by asking an initial question, receiving a response, and then asking a follow-up question that requires knowledge of the first question. The agent should correctly answer the follow-up question based on its memory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the agent is initialized, **When** the user asks "quanto é 1+1?", **Then** the agent responds with the correct answer (e.g., "2").
2.  **Given** the agent has responded to "quanto é 1+1?", **When** the user asks "Qual foi minha primeira pergunta?", **Then** the agent responds with "quanto é 1+1?".

### Edge Cases

-   What happens if the agent is asked a question that requires memory before any initial interaction?
-   How does the system handle a very long conversation history? (This is a future consideration, not for MVP)

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST initialize an AI agent capable of maintaining conversational memory.
-   **FR-002**: The agent MUST use the Gemini LLM for generating responses.
-   **FR-003**: The agent MUST be able to process an initial user question.
-   **FR-004**: The agent MUST be able to generate a response to the initial question.
-   **FR-005**: The agent MUST be able to process a follow-up question that relies on the context of the initial question.
-   **FR-006**: The agent MUST correctly recall and respond to the follow-up question based on its memory of the initial question.
-   **FR-007**: The agent's code MUST be located in the `agente_memoria` directory.

### Key Entities

-   **Agent**: The AI entity that processes questions and generates responses, maintaining conversational state.
-   **Conversation History**: The sequence of questions and answers exchanged between the user and the agent, used for memory.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The agent successfully answers the initial question "quanto é 1+1?" with the correct numerical answer.
-   **SC-002**: The agent successfully answers the follow-up question "Qual foi minha primeira pergunta?" by accurately recalling the initial question.
-   **SC-003**: The agent responds to both questions within 5 seconds.
