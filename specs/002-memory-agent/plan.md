# Implementation Plan: Memory Agent

**Branch**: `002-memory-agent` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: /root/code/langgraph/specs/002-memory-agent/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-memory-agent/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an AI agent with conversational memory using `langgraph` and `gemini-2.5-flash`. The agent will be able to answer an initial question and then a follow-up question that requires recalling the first interaction, demonstrating its memory capabilities. The code will reside in a new `agente_memoria` directory, leveraging patterns and code from the existing `agente_simples` project.

**Technical Context**:

*Note: This plan incorporates insights from `external_docs/langgraph_docs.md` and `research/langgraph_checkpointers.md`.*

**Language/Version**
**Primary Dependencies**: `langgraph`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `langchain-google-genai`
**Storage**: `langgraph` for in-memory state management (for this simple case)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Console
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must use `gemini-2.5-flash` LLM. Agent must maintain memory per thread.
**Scale/Scope**: A single agent demonstrating conversational memory for a short interaction.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   **I. Library-First**: The agent will be developed as a self-contained module within `agente_memoria`.
-   **II. CLI Interface**: The agent will expose its functionality via a command-line interface.
-   **III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Tests will be written to fail before the implementation of the agent's memory logic.
-   **IV. Integration Testing**: The memory aspect of the agent will require integration tests to verify conversational flow.
-   **V. Observability**: Standard Python logging practices will be applied if necessary for debugging and monitoring.

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
agente_memoria/
├── main.py
└── .env

tests/
└── test_agent_memoria.py
```

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is sufficient for this agent. The agent's code will be in `agente_memoria/main.py`, and its dedicated test will be in `tests/test_agent_memoria.py`. The `.env` file will be copied from `agente_simples` to `agente_memoria` for quick setup.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations of the constitution are anticipated.
